<h4 align="center">Bitflix is an open source web application to watch movies and TV shows with multi-language subtitles completely for free.</h4>

## Motivation
Nowadays watching a movie or a TV Show episode could be a little hard. We have a lot of different streaming applications where the content is really different between them and the user has to pay all of them to have access to a good amount of movies and TV Shows.
Of course, we all know some free websites where there is a lot of content but at the same time this apps are managed by people with economic interests, so the final result is a product with a lot of ads that make the UI/UX worse.
Our idea behind Bitflix is just to make an infinite-content free web application without any ad, focusing on the user experience.

## Getting started
<code>git clone https://github.com/bitflix-official/Bitflix && cd Bitflix</code>
<br />
<br />
<code>yarn add</code>
<br />
### Environment
Create an <code>.env.local</code> file at the root of the project with the following variables:
<br />
- <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL</code>: Database where Bitflix's users and their data like lists and profile images are hosted. To avoid issues on the production database, I suggest you to <a href="https://app.supabase.io/">create your own database</a> with a 'profiles' table with the following schema:<br /><br /> <img width="1200" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27747658/157371850-7765d318-722a-4cd8-a59d-a7db99e9ef83.png"><br />Once you have done that, add your supabase url as a value.
- <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY</code>: Same as before, once you have done your 'profiles' database on Supabase with the previously mentioned schema, add your supabase anon key as a value.
- <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY</code>
- <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_STREAMING_URL=YOUR_OWN_PEERFLIX_SERVER OR https://bitflix-api.herokuapp.com</code>
- <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_SUBTITLES_URL=YOUR_OWN_SUBTITLES_SERVER OR https://bitflix-subs.herokuapp.com</code>
- <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_TV_URL=YOUR_OWN_TV_SERVER OR https://bitflix-tv.herokuapp.com</code>
<br />
<code>yarn run dev</code>
<br />
<br />
App should have been started on localhost:3000 ðŸš€
